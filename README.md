## Switch between two dynamically-rendered Twitter profiles.
- Base url defaults to Bill Gates (user2) - https://86hzv.csb.app/
- You can switch between Bill Gates and Elon Musk by changing the url query - https://86hzv.csb.app/?user=user1 or https://86hzv.csb.app/?user=user2
- Everything was done with HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript.
